Description: interface to various collation algorithms for Python
 Supported backends:
 - icu - Based on the IBM ICU toolkit and Jim Fulton's zope.ucol.
 - syslocale - Native OS collation routines.
 - codepoint - Raw Unicode codepoint comparison
 .
 The different backends have varying features and behaviors; which one
 is best depends on your goals. A specific backend can be used, or a
 "best" backend is chosen by default.
 .
 pycollate also provides tools to perform word-wise and numeric sorts.
 .
 pycollate, as with all Unicode collation tools, is a work in progress.
